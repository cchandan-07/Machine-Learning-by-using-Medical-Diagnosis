# Medical Diagnosis by using Machine Learning

## Overview

Welcome to the Medical Diagnosis Machine Learning! This project aims to provide Collect diverse and comprehensive medical datasets for targeted conditions. Clean and preprocess data to ensure accuracy and completeness. Identify and optimize key diagnostic features for each medical condition. Select and train machine learning models tailored to each diagnosis for optimal accuracy. Define and measure performance metrics specific to each medical condition for effective model evaluation. Validate models rigorously using diverse datasets to ensure reliability and generalizability. Establish mechanisms for ongoing monitoring, updates, and incorporation of the latest medical knowledge.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this tool, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version >= 3.6)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the pre-trained model for medical diagnosis, follow these steps:

1. Provide input data (medical images) following the guidelines in the [Input](#input) section.
2. Run the prediction script:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input_path /path/to/input_data
   ```

### Input

The input data should be a collection of medical images in a supported format (e.g., JPEG, PNG). Place the images in a directory and provide the path to that directory as the input.

### Output

The prediction script will output the diagnosis results for each input image, indicating the likelihood of specific medical conditions.

## Model Training

### Dataset

To train the model on dataset, follow these steps:

1. Diabetes:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
2. Cancer: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
3. liver: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records
4. Kidney: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansoordaku/ckdisease


### Training

Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py --config_path /path/to/config.yaml
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation script:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved_model --test_data /path/to/test_data
```
